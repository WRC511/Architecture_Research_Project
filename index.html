                    Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House, completed in 1907, is a masterpiece of Prairie-style 
                    architecture located in Buffalo, New York. The complex features a low-profile design with 
                    horizontal lines and a front entrance that is not immediately obvious, enhancing privacy 
                    for the residents.<br><br>
                    Wright's aversion to curtains led him to incorporate nearly 400 art 
                    glass windows throughout the complex, serving as light screens to visually connect exterior 
                    views with interior spaces while maintaining privacy. The front porch area, with its low awning, 
                    was intentionally designed to discourage lingering, further promoting the family's seclusion. 
                    Inside the house, Wright created a subtle and understated staircase, reflecting his belief that 
                    the upstairs should be a personal, private family area.

                    Villa Savoye, designed by Le Corbusier and completed in 1931, is a masterpiece of modern architecture 
                    located near Paris, France. The house's elevated design, supported by slender concrete pillars (pilotis), 
                    creates a sense of privacy by lifting the main living spaces off the ground. 
                    <br><br>
                    Le Corbusier's use of long horizontal windows, while providing ample natural light, also allows for 
                    controlled views and maintains privacy for the occupants. The first floor, which contains the private spaces 
                    such as bedrooms and bathrooms, is designed with an emphasis on functionality and simplicity, further enhancing 
                    the sense of seclusion. Additionally, the rooftop garden and terrace offer a private outdoor space for the 
                    residents, reclaiming nature while maintaining separation from the surrounding environment.

                    Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation, completed in 1952 in Marseille, France, is a pioneering example 
                    of modernist residential architecture. The building's apartments are designed to span from one side to 
                    the other, with double-height living spaces, reducing the number of corridors to one every three floors 
                    and enhancing privacy for residents. Le Corbusier ensured that there was no contact between different apartments, 
                    which were soundproofed to guarantee the privacy of each family. The apartments feature loggias with brise-soleil, 
                    providing outdoor space while maintaining privacy and controlling sunlight. Additionally, the building's elevated design 
                    on pilotis not only creates a striking visual effect but also lifts the main living spaces off the ground, further 
                    contributing to the residents' sense of seclusion.

                    Broadacre City: Privacy, Space, and the Decentralized Urban Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright
                    <br><br>
                    Frank Lloyd Wright presented his conceptual urban planning idea for Broadacre City in 1932, questioning the time's centralized 
                    and high-density metropolitan settings. Wright suggested a low-density, dispersed community where every family would get at 
                    least one acre of land to dwell on, guaranteeing physical and visible seclusion, unlike the grid-based urban model of cities 
                    like New York and Chicago.<br><br>
                    The idea sprang from the American ethos of self-sufficiency and individuality. Wright dreamed of a world where every person had 
                    enough room to live independently, lessening reliance on packed metropolitan areas. Broadacre City pushed automobile-centric architecture,  
                    removing the necessity for public transportation hubs that sometimes violated privacy. Roads linking residences, shops, and civic 
                    institutions connected buildings that were to be widely spread apart, and zoning rules would segregate industrial, residential, and commercial 
                    areas, therefore limiting unwelcome interference into people’s personal spheres.<br><br>
                    Although Broadacre City never was developed, Wright's ideas heavily shaped suburban growth in the middle of the 20th century, when the emergence 
                    of vast suburban areas reflected elements of his vision.

                    Balancing Transparency and Privacy: Architectural Design and Surveillance in Higher Education Institutions
                    <br><br>
                    Higher education institutions have progressively included monitoring technologies onto their campuses in recent years, 
                    consistently raising privacy issues and affecting the academic environment. One such example is the University of Melbourne, 
                    under investigation for its monitoring of student activists using surveillance technologies. 
                    The Victorian Information Commissioner's (OVIC) investigation into the institution in August 2024 for using Wi-Fi location data and 
                    CCTV footage to reprimand students engaged in a pro-Palestine protest brought attention to the conflict between personal privacy rights 
                    and university security policies.<br><br>
                    Similarly, in the United States, the development of surveillance devices in learning environments has been increasingly notable in modern times. 
                    Critics of tools meant to improve safety and track academic success have attacked their compromise of student autonomy and privacy. 
                    Although meant to be protective, these technologies have begged moral considerations regarding the degree of surveillance, and how it affects the learning process for students.

                    Reimagining Architectural Privacy: A Topological Framework for Spatial Design
                    <br><br>
                    In 2006, at the Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London, Michail Georgiou presented a 
                    master's thesis titled "Architectural Privacy: A Topological Approach to Relational Design Problems". 
                    His work investigates the abstract quality of privacy within architectural spaces, focusing on how enclosed, 
                    boundary-defined areas can be analyzed and designed to achieve desired privacy levels.<br><br>
                    Georgiou evaluated architectural proposals using a programming environment built from the Processing programming language. 
                    This instrument creates conceptual topological diagrams showing the connections between locations depending on given degrees 
                    of privacy. Both analytical and synthetic tools, these diagrams let architects record current spatial layouts and test new ideas, 
                    fit for certain socio-cultural settings.<br><br>
                    The work stresses that privacy is a dynamic topological aspect of space rather than a fixed quality. Georgiou's method provides a 
                    complex view of architectural design by grouping places based on their ability to control privacy, therefore transcending the 
                    conventional binary division of spaces as either public or private.

                    The Oculus, built in 2016 at the World Trade Center in New York City, was designed by Santiago Calatrava after 9/11. 
                    The structure reflects the priorities of the early 21st century by emphasizing openness and security. Its spacious 1,500-foot-long 
                    concourse and retractable skylight create clear sightlines, making it easier to monitor crowds and manage movement. 
                    The hub connects to the PATH and NYC subway systems, integrating with modern security measures like centralized camera networks and AI-driven anomaly detection. 
                    This technology uses artificial intelligence to analyze surveillance footage in real-time, identifying unusual behavior (e.g., someone leaving a 
                    bag unattended or moving erratically) to alert security teams. The elliptical walkways are designed to guide passengers efficiently while minimizing 
                    hidden areas, a feature influenced by post-9/11 efforts to improve visibility and safety.<br><br> 
                    However, privacy considerations are limited—restrooms are located in nearby retail spaces rather than within the transit areas, 
                    meaning travelers must rely on highly visible, public zones for basic needs. 
                    The Oculus demonstrates how modern transit hubs often prioritize collective security over individual privacy. Unlike airports that have 
                    added private amenities like nursing rooms, subway-linked hubs like the Oculus tend to focus more on functionality and safety rather than 
                    personal comfort or privacy. The Oculus' striking architectural design, with its soaring white ribs and bird-like form, elicits a profound 
                    emotional response from visitors that overshadows security systems within the space. Instead, they are left with an impression of grandeur 
                    and innovation, which can mask the omnipresence of surveillance.

                    Grand Central Terminal in New York City, built in 1913, is a prime example of Beaux-Arts architecture. This style of 
                    buildings often feature large, open spaces; arched windows and doors; intricate decorative details like sculptures and 
                    carvings; and materials such as marble and limestone. These design elements create a sense of formality and opulence while 
                    ensuring the building serves its purpose efficiently, such as regulating foot traffic through well-planned layouts.<br><br>
                    In Grand Central, the Beaux-Arts design emphasizes smooth passenger flow with features like vaulted ceilings and wide concourses. 
                    The terminal also included "kissing galleries," semi-private spaces where travelers could reunite with loved ones. However, reflecting 
                    early 20th-century norms, privacy was not a significant consideration in public spaces like subway areas—evident in the lack of restrooms 
                    within the subway system.<br><br> 
                    During renovations in the 1990s, Grand Central Terminal added over 500 security cameras connected to a central system (networked CCTV), 
                    allowing live monitoring from a control room. The terminal’s iconic high ceiling—taller than a 10-story building—helps these cameras 
                    cover wide areas, like how a tall lighthouse sees farther. The original 1913 design features, such as curved walkways that naturally guide 
                    foot traffic, now unintentionally help modern AI-powered crowd analytics. This software uses camera feeds to track crowd density, spot 
                    unattended bags, or detect unusual movements. While the terminal’s grand arches and open spaces were meant to impress travelers in the past, 
                    today they also make it easier for AI systems to monitor crowds.<br><br>
                    In short: older design choices (high ceilings, walkway shapes) have been repurposed to support digital surveillance tools 
                    that didn’t exist when the terminal was built.

                    Singapore’s Jewel Changi Airport, completed in 2019, is a stunning architectural and technological marvel designed 
                    to enhance traveler comfort while integrating advanced surveillance systems. Its notable features include the 
                    world’s tallest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex, surrounded by the lush Shiseido Forest Valley, as well as attractions like 
                    Canopy Park, retail spaces, and rest areas such as snooze lounges and YOTELAIR cabins for privacy and relaxation. 
                    These amenities provide travelers with spaces to unwind and recharge during their journeys.<br><br>
                    However, Jewel Changi Airport also employs extensive surveillance technology, including 2,500 CCTV cameras and 
                    facial recognition systems. These tools are used for purposes such as monitoring crowd movement, locating lost 
                    passengers, and streamlining processes like check-ins and immigration clearance. Additionally, the Jewel app collects 
                    personal data such as location tracking and immigration details to enhance the user experience. While these systems 
                    improve efficiency and security for the airport's 50 million annual visitors, they also raise concerns about potential privacy violations.<br><br>
                    The collection of biometric data—such as facial recognition scans—makes travelers susceptible to risks like identity theft or 
                    unauthorized data access if the systems are compromised. Furthermore, the integration of surveillance into everyday interactions at 
                    the airport normalizes data collection practices, leaving travelers with limited control over how their personal information is used. 
                    This highlights the balance Jewel Changi Airport seeks to strike between offering convenience and ensuring security while addressing 
                    privacy concerns in an increasingly connected world.

        A Historical Analysis of Privacy's Influence on Architectural Design <br><br>
        Nowadays in our digital-enveloped society, architectural privacy has become a topic that describes our digital infrastructure 
        and raises large-scale concerns on how much unwanted and non consensual exposure we have on the internet.<br> 
        However, for this project, our team has taken an interest in exploring the concept of privacy as it relates to the physical world. 
        Specifically, we aim to answer: how are design decisions (and solutions) influenced by evolving notions of the need for privacy 
        in different types of physical spaces within society over time?

    <div class="page-content" id="goal">
        We Investigated Privacy In 3 Areas of Architecture<br><br>
        Domestic Privacy: <br>To analyze how the design of homes (interior layouts, facades, and landscaping) has evolved in response to changing notions of privacy from the late 1700s to the present day. We will look at the impact of social class, technological advancements (e.g., the introduction of electricity and modern plumbing), and cultural shifts on residential architecture.<br><br>
        Societal Privacy: <br>To investigate the role of privacy in the design of public and civic buildings, such as museums, government structures, and educational institutions, with a particular focus on the period starting with the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>
        Transportation Privacy: <br>To explore how infringements on privacy, driven by security concerns and technological surveillance, have influenced the design of transportation hubs like airports and train stations from the 20th century to today.

    <div class="page-content" id="approach">
        Our Research Approach <br><br>
        Literature Review: <br>We will conduct secondary research using existing scholarly articles, books, and architectural publications related to the history of privacy and its influence on architectural design. Key themes will be identified.<br><br>
        Case Studies: <br>We will choose case studies of specific buildings and spaces as examples of the evolving relationship between privacy and architecture. These case studies will be selected to represent different historical periods, building types, and geographical locations. We will interview a property manager to gain insight into privacy features in modern architecture.<br><br>
        Archival Research: <br>We will explore architectural archives, scholarly sources, and visual materials to gather primary source data on the design and use of buildings across the three focus areas.
