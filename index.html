                    Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House, completed in 1907, is a masterpiece of Prairie-style 
                    architecture located in Buffalo, New York. The complex features a low-profile design with 
                    horizontal lines and a front entrance that is not immediately obvious, enhancing privacy 
                    for the residents.<br><br>
                    Wright's aversion to curtains led him to incorporate nearly 400 art 
                    glass windows throughout the complex, serving as light screens to visually connect exterior 
                    views with interior spaces while maintaining privacy. The front porch area, with its low awning, 
                    was intentionally designed to discourage lingering, further promoting the family's seclusion. 
                    Inside the house, Wright created a subtle and understated staircase, reflecting his belief that 
                    the upstairs should be a personal, private family area.

                    Villa Savoye, designed by Le Corbusier and completed in 1931, is a masterpiece of modern architecture 
                    located near Paris, France. The house's elevated design, supported by slender concrete pillars (pilotis), 
                    creates a sense of privacy by lifting the main living spaces off the ground. 
                    <br><br>
                    Le Corbusier's use of long horizontal windows, while providing ample natural light, also allows for 
                    controlled views and maintains privacy for the occupants. The first floor, which contains the private spaces 
                    such as bedrooms and bathrooms, is designed with an emphasis on functionality and simplicity, further enhancing 
                    the sense of seclusion. Additionally, the rooftop garden and terrace offer a private outdoor space for the 
                    residents, reclaiming nature while maintaining separation from the surrounding environment.

                <div class="info-box">
                    Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation, completed in 1952 in Marseille, France, is a pioneering example 
                    of modernist residential architecture. The building's apartments are designed to span from one side to 
                    the other, with double-height living spaces, reducing the number of corridors to one every three floors 
                    and enhancing privacy for residents. Le Corbusier ensured that there was no contact between different apartments, 
                    which were soundproofed to guarantee the privacy of each family. The apartments feature loggias with brise-soleil, 
                    providing outdoor space while maintaining privacy and controlling sunlight. Additionally, the building's elevated design 
                    on pilotis not only creates a striking visual effect but also lifts the main living spaces off the ground, further 
                    contributing to the residents' sense of seclusion.

                    The Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Gehry, features a striking exterior of curved titanium forms that catch and reflect light, 
                    creating a sculptural landmark. Inside, the building is organized around a soaring 50-meter high atrium nicknamed "The Flower," 
                    which serves as the central hub from which 19 galleries branch out. <br><br>The museum's innovative design incorporates curved walkways, 
                    glass elevators, and staircases that connect the three levels, offering visitors unique perspectives and movement through the space. 
                    While the atrium provides an open, light-filled area, the individual galleries offer more intimate settings, with some retaining classic 
                    rectangular shapes and others adopting fluid, organic forms. The variety of gallery spaces, including some with irregular lines and others 
                    with classical proportions, allows curators to create diverse atmospheres for exhibitions, enabling both grand displays of large-format works 
                    and more private, intimate viewing experiences for smaller pieces.<br><br>

                    The U.S. Embassy in Paris, located at 2 Avenue Gabriel on the northwest corner of the Place de la Concorde, was designed 
                    by American firm Delano & Aldrich and French architect Victor Laloux in 1931. The four-story chancery building's façade 
                    conforms with other structures on the Place de la Concorde, as required by French law, maintaining a harmonious architectural 
                    aesthetic. Two sculpted eagles adorn the main entrance pillars on Avenue Gabriel, symbolizing the American presence while blending 
                    with the local stonework. The embassy complex includes the chancery, the Hôtel de Talleyrand, and the ambassador's residence 
                    (Hôtel de Pontalba), each contributing to the diplomatic mission's functional and ceremonial needs. While specific privacy features 
                    are not detailed in most documentation, the embassy employs various security technologies to protect information and routinely tests 
                    its security measures, suggesting an emphasis on privacy and confidentiality in its design and operations.<br><br>

                    Grand Central Terminal, completed in 1913, is a masterpiece of Beaux-Arts architecture 
                    with its iconic facade and grand interior spaces. The terminal's design incorporates numerous security 
                    cameras strategically placed throughout the building, including in stairwells, platforms, and the main concourse, 
                    allowing for comprehensive surveillance of the bustling crowds. In 2010, hundreds of MTA subway security cameras 
                    in Grand Central were directly linked to the NYPD's security operation center, enabling real-time monitoring and 
                    potentially raising privacy concerns for travelers. The terminal's open layout, featuring wide passageways and a 
                    vast main concourse, facilitates crowd movement but also allows for easier visual monitoring of passengers. 
                    Additionally, the installation of high-resolution digital displays throughout the terminal, while primarily used 
                    for providing train information, could potentially be utilized for facial recognition or other surveillance purposes.

                    College Park Airport, established in August 1909, is the world's oldest continuously 
                    operating airport located in College Park, Maryland. Initially created as a training site 
                    for the United States Army Signal Corps, it played a crucial role in early aviation history. 
                    The airport's original design was simple, consisting of an open field for takeoffs and landings, 
                    basic hangars for aircraft storage, and rudimentary facilities. In its early years, the airport 
                    lacked modern security measures or privacy considerations, allowing free movement of people and aircraft. 
                    The site witnessed numerous aviation firsts, including the first military pilot to solo in a government airplane 
                    and the first woman to fly in a powered aircraft in the United States. Over the years, College Park Airport has 
                    evolved while maintaining its historical significance, and in 1977, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

                    Floor-to-ceiling glass and airy concourses invite abundant natural light, accentuating the sense of openness.<br><br>
                    This open layout is not only aesthetically pleasing but also facilitates effective surveillance by providing clear, unobstructed views of public areas.
                    In this way, the design balances a modern, inviting atmosphere with practical security measures that ensure the safety of all travelers.<br><br>

        A Historical Analysis of Privacy's Influence on Architectural Design <br><br>
        Nowadays in our digital-enveloped society, architectural privacy has become a topic that describes our digital infrastructure 
        and raises large-scale concerns on how much unwanted and non consensual exposure we have on the internet.<br> 
        However, for this project, our team has taken an interest in exploring the concept of privacy as it relates to the physical world. 
        Specifically, we aim to answer: how are design decisions (and solutions) influenced by evolving notions of the need for privacy 
        in different types of physical spaces within society over time?

    <div class="page-content" id="goal">
        We Investigated Privacy In 3 Areas of Architecture<br><br>
        Domestic Privacy: <br>To analyze how the design of homes (interior layouts, facades, and landscaping) has evolved in response to changing notions of privacy from the late 1700s to the present day. We will look at the impact of social class, technological advancements (e.g., the introduction of electricity and modern plumbing), and cultural shifts on residential architecture.<br><br>
        Societal Privacy: <br>To investigate the role of privacy in the design of public and civic buildings, such as museums, government structures, and educational institutions, with a particular focus on the period starting with the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>
        Transportation Privacy: <br>To explore how infringements on privacy, driven by security concerns and technological surveillance, have influenced the design of transportation hubs like airports and train stations from the 20th century to today.

        Our Research Approach <br><br>
        Literature Review: <br>We will conduct secondary research using existing scholarly articles, books, and architectural publications related to the history of privacy and its influence on architectural design. Key themes will be identified.<br><br>
        Case Studies: <br>We will choose case studies of specific buildings and spaces as examples of the evolving relationship between privacy and architecture. These case studies will be selected to represent different historical periods, building types, and geographical locations. We will interview a property manager to gain insight into privacy features in modern architecture.<br><br>
        Archival Research: <br>We will explore architectural archives, scholarly sources, and visual materials to gather primary source data on the design and use of buildings across the three focus areas.
