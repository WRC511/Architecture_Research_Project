                    1800's Victorian House<br><br>
                    Victorian architecture, prevalent during Queen Victoria's reign from 1837 to 1901, is characterized by ornate 
                    and decorative elements, asymmetrical designs, and a focus on grandeur. These homes often featured steeply 
                    pitched roofs, ornate gables, bay windows, and intricate trim work, creating a distinctive dollhouse-like appearance.<br><br> 
                    Privacy features in Victorian homes included set-back front doors placed to one side of the façade, often in deep 
                    recesses, which provided increased seclusion for residents. The use of stained glass windows and doors not only added 
                    aesthetic appeal but also offered privacy by obscuring views into the home. Additionally, Victorian houses typically 
                    had complicated layouts with multiple rooms, including formal dining rooms, libraries, and parlors, allowing for more 
                    private spaces within the home.

                    Servant Staircases<br><br>
                    Victorian homes with servant staircases typically featured a dual staircase system: a grand, 
                    ornate main staircase for the family and guests, and a narrow, steep secondary staircase for servants. 
                    These servant staircases were often hidden from view, located off the kitchen or back part of the house, 
                    designed to keep household staff out of sight while moving between floors.<br><br> 
                    The servant stairs were characteristically steep with small steps, significant rises between them, 
                    and often lacked handrails, making them potentially dangerous for users. In larger Victorian mansions, 
                    these utilitarian passages were essential for the efficient movement of staff but were built with minimal 
                    consideration for comfort or safety. Despite their practical purpose, modern homeowners often find these 
                    hidden staircases charming and intriguing, viewing them as unique architectural features that offer a glimpse 
                    into the social dynamics of the Victorian era.

                    Modern Open-concept Home<br><br>
                    Modern open-concept homes feature expansive, multi-functional spaces that combine living, dining, 
                    and kitchen areas into a single, flowing environment. These designs typically incorporate large windows 
                    and glass doors to maximize natural light and create a seamless connection with outdoor spaces.<br><br> 
                    To address privacy concerns, homeowners are increasingly employing clever solutions such as sliding barn doors, 
                    bookshelf partitions, and hanging planters as green dividers to create separate zones without sacrificing the open feel. 
                    Some designs integrate smart storage solutions and strategic furniture placement to delineate different areas while 
                    maintaining visual continuity. Additionally, the use of vertical slat wood partitions and half-walls with built-in storage 
                    offers a balance between openness and privacy, allowing for customizable levels of separation within the open floor plan.<br><br>

                    The Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Gehry, features a striking exterior of curved titanium forms that catch and reflect light, 
                    creating a sculptural landmark. Inside, the building is organized around a soaring 50-meter high atrium nicknamed "The Flower," 
                    which serves as the central hub from which 19 galleries branch out. <br><br>The museum's innovative design incorporates curved walkways, 
                    glass elevators, and staircases that connect the three levels, offering visitors unique perspectives and movement through the space. 
                    While the atrium provides an open, light-filled area, the individual galleries offer more intimate settings, with some retaining classic 
                    rectangular shapes and others adopting fluid, organic forms. The variety of gallery spaces, including some with irregular lines and others 
                    with classical proportions, allows curators to create diverse atmospheres for exhibitions, enabling both grand displays of large-format works 
                    and more private, intimate viewing experiences for smaller pieces.<br><br>

                    The U.S. Embassy in Paris, located at 2 Avenue Gabriel on the northwest corner of the Place de la Concorde, was designed 
                    by American firm Delano & Aldrich and French architect Victor Laloux in 1931. The four-story chancery building's façade 
                    conforms with other structures on the Place de la Concorde, as required by French law, maintaining a harmonious architectural 
                    aesthetic. Two sculpted eagles adorn the main entrance pillars on Avenue Gabriel, symbolizing the American presence while blending 
                    with the local stonework. The embassy complex includes the chancery, the Hôtel de Talleyrand, and the ambassador's residence 
                    (Hôtel de Pontalba), each contributing to the diplomatic mission's functional and ceremonial needs. While specific privacy features 
                    are not detailed in most documentation, the embassy employs various security technologies to protect information and routinely tests 
                    its security measures, suggesting an emphasis on privacy and confidentiality in its design and operations.<br><br>

        A Historical Analysis of Privacy's Influence on Architectural Design <br><br>
        Nowadays in our digital-enveloped society, architectural privacy has become a topic that describes our digital infrastructure 
        and raises large-scale concerns on how much unwanted and non consensual exposure we have on the internet.<br> 
        However, for this project, our team has taken an interest in exploring the concept of privacy as it relates to the physical world. 
        Specifically, we aim to answer: how are design decisions (and solutions) influenced by evolving notions of the need for privacy 
        in different types of physical spaces within society over time?

    <div class="page-content" id="goal">
        We Investigated Privacy In 3 Areas of Architecture<br><br>
        Domestic Privacy: <br>To analyze how the design of homes (interior layouts, facades, and landscaping) has evolved in response to changing notions of privacy from the late 1700s to the present day. We will look at the impact of social class, technological advancements (e.g., the introduction of electricity and modern plumbing), and cultural shifts on residential architecture.<br><br>
        Societal Privacy: <br>To investigate the role of privacy in the design of public and civic buildings, such as museums, government structures, and educational institutions, with a particular focus on the period starting with the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>
        Transportation Privacy: <br>To explore how infringements on privacy, driven by security concerns and technological surveillance, have influenced the design of transportation hubs like airports and train stations from the 20th century to today.

    <div class="page-content" id="approach">
        Our Research Approach <br><br>
        Literature Review: <br>We will conduct secondary research using existing scholarly articles, books, and architectural publications related to the history of privacy and its influence on architectural design. Key themes will be identified.<br><br>
        Case Studies: <br>We will choose case studies of specific buildings and spaces as examples of the evolving relationship between privacy and architecture. These case studies will be selected to represent different historical periods, building types, and geographical locations. We will interview a property manager to gain insight into privacy features in modern architecture.<br><br>
        Archival Research: <br>We will explore architectural archives, scholarly sources, and visual materials to gather primary source data on the design and use of buildings across the three focus areas.
